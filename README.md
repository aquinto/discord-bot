# discord-bot

A simple discord bot that is used to moderate our discord server between my friends and I. 
The discord bot is written in javascript and uses the discord.js module. 

It uses the discord.js module to provide an easy interaction with the Discord API 
their documentation and website could be found at: https://www.discord.js.org

Apart from the discord.js documentation, the following guide was also very useful for the implementation of 
this discord bot. The guide could be found at the following link: https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin


As of August 8th, 2020 the bot can do:
- handle various commands such as !216 that will help send links to resources for our computer science classes 
- allow users to delete up to 50 messages in a text channel
